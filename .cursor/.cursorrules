# Product Development Workflows for Cursor

This project uses structured workflows for product development with Cursor AI.

---

## Core Principles (P0 - Always Follow)

### 1. Always Ask Clarifying Questions
When requirements are ambiguous, STOP and ask the user clarifying questions.

### 2. Test-Driven Development (TDD) is Mandatory
Always write tests BEFORE implementation (Red-Green-Refactor cycle).

### 3. Document Everything with Traceability
Maintain chain: Code → Ticket → TDD → PRD
Always include version: "TDD v2.1 Section 4.1" (not just "Section 4.1")

### 4. Update Documents as You Learn
PRD, TDD, and task breakdowns are LIVING DOCUMENTS. Update and version them.

### 5. Manage Linear Ticket Status
```
Todo → In Progress (when start) → Completed (after PR merge)
```

### 6. Follow Git Workflow Standards
- Branch: `feature/TICKET-ID-description`
- Commits: Conventional format (`feat:`, `fix:`, etc.)
- PR: Include ticket ID, link to Linear

### 7. Definition of Done (Universal)
- [ ] Tests passing (>80% coverage)
- [ ] No linter warnings
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] PR merged
- [ ] Ticket completed

### 8. Right-Size All Work
Max 13 story points per ticket. Break down larger work.

## How to Invoke Workflows in Cursor

When the user mentions a workflow, read the corresponding file from `.cursor/workflows/` and follow it step-by-step.

### Workflow Commands

| User Says | Read This File | Purpose |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| "Create PRD using prd-creation-workflow" | `.cursor/workflows/prd-creation-workflow.md` | Define WHAT & WHY |
| "Create TDD using tdd-creation-workflow" | `.cursor/workflows/tdd-creation-workflow.md` | Design HOW |
| "Break down using task-breakdown-workflow" | `.cursor/workflows/task-breakdown-workflow.md` | Create TICKETS |
| "Implement ticket [ID] using linear-ticket-workflow" | `.cursor/workflows/linear-ticket-workflow.md` | Build FEATURE |

### How to Reference Files in Cursor

Use `@filename` syntax to reference workflow files:
- `@.cursor/workflows/prd-creation-workflow.md`
- `@.cursor/workflows/tdd-creation-workflow.md`
- `@.cursor/reference/quick-reference.md`

### Quick Reference

For cheat sheet, reference: `@.cursor/reference/quick-reference.md`

## Decision Tree

```
Idea → PRD → TDD → Tickets → Implementation
  ↓       ↓      ↓       ↓           ↓
  1       2      3       4           5
```

---

## Tools

- **Linear** - Update ticket status, create tickets (use Linear integration or API)
- **GitHub CLI** - Create PRs with `gh pr create`
- **Cursor Composer** - Use Cmd+I for multi-file edits
- **Cursor Chat** - Use Cmd+L for questions and guidance

---

## Document Versioning

PRD and TDD use semantic versioning: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

Always reference version in tickets:
- ✅ "See TDD v2.1 Section 4.1"
- ❌ "See TDD Section 4.1"

---

## File Locations

- Workflows: `.cursor/workflows/*.md`
- Templates: `.cursor/reference/*-template.md`
- Quick Ref: `.cursor/reference/quick-reference.md`
- ADR Template: `.cursor/reference/adr-template.md`

---

## Cursor-Specific Commands

### Using Cursor Chat (Cmd+L)
```
"Create a PRD for [feature] using the prd-creation-workflow"
"Help me implement ticket PROJ-42 using the linear-ticket-workflow"
```

### Using Cursor Composer (Cmd+I)
When implementing across multiple files, use Composer with workflow context:
```
"Implement the API endpoint from TDD v2.1 Section 4.1 using the linear-ticket-workflow"
```

### Reference Workflows Mid-Conversation
```
"Following the tdd-creation-workflow, let's design the architecture"
"According to the prd-creation-workflow, what questions should we ask?"
```
